## About this Application:
Showing the difference between reference and copy
1. Array
    - reference the original array vs copy with `.slice()`, `.concat()`, spread operator (`...`) and `Array.from()`.

2. Object
    - reference the original object vs copy with `Object.assign()`, spread operator(`...`),
    - Check `Object.assign()` only works for one level. Use `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` for whole levels.
